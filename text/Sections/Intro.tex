As shown in multiple research over the years, languages do have some statistical regularities and patterns that are quantifiable and mathematically analyzable. These characteristics have multiple technical applications, and also, they can allow us to understand the origins of languages and the reasons they exist in the way we know them.

In this research project, we are going to analyze two predictions of optimal coding for studying word length. Firstly, we will look at the correlation between word length and frequency rank, and secondly at the correlation between word length and relative frequency.

These correlations have not been extensively studied, a study was produced for the English language \cite{torre2019physical} and another one for Spanish and Catalan \cite{hernandez2019linguistic}. In this work, we intend to extend this study to a larger set of languages with different characteristics and from different families.
